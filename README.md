# RiceDiscordBot
This is a Discord bot I made for use with friends. It proved to be a good way to learn more about calling APIs 
and web scraping with Python. It automatically pulls updates from git and restarts itself once a day using 
```cron``` so that people can easily add new commands. It currently runs on a Raspberry Pi.
